# Hangman Game in Python
# his is a simple hangman game that I built using Python. The game randomly chooses a word from a list and asks the user to guess it letter by letter. 
# The user has a limited number of guesses before they lose. The game can be played in the terminal or in a graphical user interface.
# To run the game, you can either use the terminal or the graphical user interface. To use the terminal,
# navigate to the project folder and run the command: python hangman.py To use the graphical user interface, double-click on the hangman_gui.py file.
